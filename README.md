# CLIT (Cool Little Interesting Thing) MkI
 An Arduino program that does multiple jobs (Display an image, turn on a radio, and tell the time) I will probably make a more advance MkII, and will add a pdf of the design for the wiring, will also try to make this as efficient as possible.
 Whilst this was and has been made for an Arduino Mega 2560, it is under 31KB so you can modify the code to be compatible with an UNO.

 List of parts:
    Arduino Mega 2560 (or Uno R3)
    DS3231 RTC (Clock Module)
    TEA5767 (Radio Module, yeah its rubbish and won't connect to anything, a note for MkII)
    SSD1306 0.96" OLED 128*64 pixels (Screen)
